      "Mild Nonproliferative Diabetic Retinopathy is the earliest stage of diabetic retinopathy, marked by microaneurysms in the retinal blood vessels. Early detection is key to preventing progression.",
    overview:
      "This is the earliest stage of diabetic retinopathy and the first indication of the eye condition. The earliest sign of mild NPDR is the presence of tiny bulges in the retina’s blood vessels. Experts refer to these areas of swelling as microaneurysms. This stage of retinopathy is very common in people living with diabetes. Microaneurysms typically appear as small red dots in the retina and may leak small amounts of blood. As these microaneurysms result in small amounts of fluid leaking into the retina, it may trigger swelling of the macula, which helps people process what they see directly in front of them. At this stage, a person may not notice any symptoms, as mild NPDR will not typically impact a person’s vision. A person will not usually require treatment at this stage. However, if a doctor identifies this stage, they will recommend taking steps to prevent the condition from worsening.",
    symptoms:
      "There are generally no noticeable symptoms at this stage. Vision may remain unaffected, making regular eye exams crucial for early detection.",
    treatmentOptions:
      "While treatment is usually not required at this stage, maintaining good blood sugar control and regular monitoring is recommended to prevent progression.",

      "Moderate Nonproliferative Diabetic Retinopathy involves increased swelling in the retina's blood vessels, which begins to impede blood flow, causing fluid accumulation.",
    overview:
      "At this stage, blood vessels in the retina swell further and impede blood flow, leading to fluid accumulation in the macula. Multiple microaneurysms are present, and blood and other fluids may accumulate in the macula, causing symptoms such as blurry vision. This stage has a significant risk of progression to more severe stages. A 2020 retrospective study suggests a 17.6% probability for a person with moderate NPDR to progress to severe NPDR or PDR within 5 years of diagnosis.",
    symptoms:
      "Blurry vision or mild vision problems may start to become noticeable as fluid accumulates in the macula.",
    treatmentOptions:
      "Improved blood sugar control, regular eye monitoring, and possibly laser therapy are recommended to manage the condition and prevent further progression.",

      "Severe Nonproliferative Diabetic Retinopathy is marked by significant blockages in retinal blood vessels, leading to a decrease in blood flow and the body's response to grow new vessels.",
    overview:
      "In this stage, large portions of retinal blood vessels become blocked, severely restricting blood flow. This condition prompts the development of new, fragile blood vessels or the remodeling of existing ones, known as intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA), due to decreased oxygen levels in the retina. Symptoms may include blurry vision, dark spots, and patches of vision loss. Severe NPDR is categorized using the 4-2-1 rule: hemorrhages in all 4 retinal quadrants, venous beading in 2 or more quadrants, and IRMA in at least 1 quadrant.",
    symptoms:
      "Noticeable visual disturbances such as blurry vision, dark spots, and patches of vision loss are common.",
    treatmentOptions:
      "Treatment often involves aggressive interventions like injections of anti-VEGF medications and laser photocoagulation to manage symptoms and prevent further damage.",

      "Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy represents the most advanced stage of the disease, characterized by the growth of new blood vessels that can lead to severe vision problems.",
    overview:
      "Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) is the most advanced stage of diabetic retinopathy. It is marked by the growth of new, fragile blood vessels on the retina and the vitreous humor, which can leak blood and cause significant vision problems. These new vessels can also lead to scar tissue formation, which may result in retinal detachment or increased eye pressure, potentially damaging the optic nerve. Prompt and intensive treatment is crucial to stabilize vision and prevent severe vision loss or blindness.",
    symptoms:
      "Symptoms may include severe vision loss, floaters, and flashes of light, often indicating bleeding or scarring in the retina.",
    treatmentOptions:
      "Treatment typically involves laser surgery to destroy abnormal blood vessels, injections to reduce swelling, and vitrectomy to remove blood from the vitreous and repair the retina.",
