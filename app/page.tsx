              "Diabetic retinopathy is a condition that affects the blood vessels in the retina, the part of your eye that senses light, and is a common complication of diabetes.You must undergo a full-scope dilated eye check-up at least once every year if you have diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy is asymptomatic in early stages but it is important to catch it in time in order to save your eyesight. Preventing or delaying vision loss is achievable through regular physical activities, proper nutrition and adhering to medication regimen for diabetic patients."

                "As the disease progresses, blood vessels in the retina may begin to bleed into the vitreousâ€”the gel-like substance inside the eye. If this occurs, you may notice dark, floating spots or cobweb-like streaks. While these spots may sometimes clear up on their own, prompt treatment is crucial. Without treatment, scar tissue can develop at the back of the eye, and bleeding may recur or worsen.",
